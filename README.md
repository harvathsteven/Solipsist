Collection of interesting payloads I have experimented with on various VMs. I will be curating personal content as well. Warning: Use kid gloves with many of
these in conjunction with a USB Rubber Ducky. These should not be used not anything other than a personal machine; woe to those who reap the consequences
otherwise.
